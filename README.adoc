=== Ops FLuxym

== To Run 
1. Ensure having Java, Clojure, NPM or Yarn installed 
2. Run `yarn run client/main` to launch client
3. Run `clj -A:dev` then `(start)`

== Overview 
We use _ReactJS_ on the frontend as the view layer 
combined with _Fulcro_ to manage the client state as
normalized client DB. We use _Pathom_ as the communication layer, 
it is based on EQL Language Query that resembles _GraphQL_ but 
without schema. Server runs on top of _HttpKit_ combined with 
_Nginx_ for SSL/Proxying.
