== Tech Overview 

We use _ReactJS_ on the frontend as the view layer 
combined with _Fulcro_ to manage the client state as
normalized client DB. We use _Pathom_ as the communication layer, 
it is based on EQL Language Query that resembles _GraphQL_ but 
without schema. Server runs on top of _HttpKit_ combined with 
_Nginx_ for SSL/Proxying.
